## Steps to run the code
#### 1. Download the code
#### 2. npm install
#### 3. npm run start


### Main Decisions regarding project
#### 1. Using express as its light and good for Node 
#### 2. Separation of concern kind of design pattern
#### 3. Used express-rate-limiter
#### 4. Used pm2 in cluster mode for better performance(If really needed though)


##### P.S : I have added the test code but for some reason its not working, you can evaluate the code though
